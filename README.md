# Face-Recognition-OpenCv1

It's a simple project that uses OpenCv to detect faces and identify them.

I have done the project in a python virtual environment.(PS: Not uploaded the environment codes.)

For the project I have imported the following libraries:

  `pip install opencv-contrib-python`
  
  `pip install pillow`
 
all other default python packages are not specified.

Uploading the code below.

## Steps to Run
1. Upload folders of images of faces to be trained into Known_Faces Folder(To be created in the main directory).
2. Run faces_trained.py
3. Run faces.py


You can try changing the variables in program to get desirable results.
Happy Recognisizng
